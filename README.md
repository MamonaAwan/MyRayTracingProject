# MyRayTracingProject
General Ray Tracing project for basic rendering. The program is a rudimentary implementation of the ray tracing algorithm. 
By increasing the number of samples, fairly good quality images can be rendered by this algorithm, while taking relatively more rendering time. This makes it unsuitable for real-time applications. However this algorithm can be efficiently used to render images for non- real time applications.
